## Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for direct use, testing and development purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Matlab (version 2016a or higher) installed on Mac OSX or Windows

The Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox is required.

### Installing

1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) in a folder you will be working from. 
2. Add the `TAGI/` folder and all the sub folders to your path in Matlab : e.g. 
    - using the "Set Path" dialog in Matlab, or 
    - by running the `addpath` function from the Matlab command window while adding all sub-folders

### Getting started

1. Set the working directory to the folder corresponding to dataset you want to run, e.g. `../TAGI/ToyExample`
2. run the `.m` function having the filename corresponding to the dataset, e.g. `ToyExample_1D.m`
